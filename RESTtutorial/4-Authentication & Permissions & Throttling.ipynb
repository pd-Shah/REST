    "The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, and will set request.user and request.auth using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.\n",

    "# Permissions\n",

    "Together with authentication and throttling, permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed. Permission checks will typically use the authentication information in the request.user and request.auth properties to determine if the incoming request should be permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions are used to grant or deny access different classes of users to different parts of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest style of permission would be to allow access to any authenticated user, and deny access to any unauthenticated user. This corresponds the IsAuthenticated class in REST framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly less strict style of permission would be to allow full access to authenticated users, but allow read-only access to unauthenticated users. This corresponds to the IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly class in REST framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How permissions are determined\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.NotAuthenticated exception will be raised, and the main body of the view will not run.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the permissions checks fail either a \"403 Forbidden\" or a \"401 Unauthorized\" response will be returned, according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.\n",
    "2. The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.\n",
    "3. The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object level permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called. As with view level permissions, an exceptions.PermissionDenied exception will be raised if the user is not allowed to act on the given object.\n",

    "#### .check_object_permissions(request, obj) \n",
